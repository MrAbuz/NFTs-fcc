# This repo will have 3 different contracts:

1. Basic NFT
2. Random IPFS hosted NFT (random at creation time)

    - Pros: Cheap
    - Cons: Someone needs to pin our data (atleast one person needs to have our data pinned)

    (thought) isnt it possible to programatically change the image/stats of an IPFS hosted data based of stats, price etc aswell?

3. Dynamic SVG NFT (hosted 100% on chain, and the image of it is gonna change based on some parameters)

    - Pros: The data is on chain!
    - Cons: MUCH more expensive! 

    Parameters: 
     - If price of ETH is above X -> Happy face
     - If price of ETH is below X -> Sad face
